# 1.3: course information step3

Let's move forward to using objects in our application. Modify the variable definitions of the App component as follows and also refactor the application so that it still works:

```
const App = () => {
  const course = 'Half Stack application development'
  const part1 = {
    name: 'Fundamentals of React',
    exercises: 10
  }
  const part2 = {
    name: 'Using props to pass data',
    exercises: 7
  }
  const part3 = {
    name: 'State of a component',
    exercises: 14
  }

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```
