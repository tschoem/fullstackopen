# 1.5: course information step5

Let's take the changes one step further. Change the course and its parts into a single JavaScript object. Fix everything that breaks.

```
const App = () => {
  const course = {
    name: 'Half Stack application development',
    parts: [
      {
        name: 'Fundamentals of React',
        exercises: 10
      },
      {
        name: 'Using props to pass data',
        exercises: 7
      },
      {
        name: 'State of a component',
        exercises: 14
      }
    ]
  }

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```
